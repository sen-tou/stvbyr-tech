Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Steve I am a web developer currently based in germany. I work mostly with PHP, Symfony, JavaScript, Vue.js and TailwindCSS.

Nowadays I focus on working with the Symfony PHP framework. I build, planed and managed a variety of projects using Symfony.

I am always curious to learn new things. Right now I am getting more familiar with Laravel and Typescript.

Besides coding I like reading sci-fi, collecting new knowledge with obsidian, learn new technologies and try new things such as this blog.

If you wanna reach out to me you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stvbyr), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-beyer-814a0b1bb/).
