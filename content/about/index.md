Hello ðŸ‘‹,

my name is Steve I am a web developer from germany. I mostly work with PHP and Frameworks like Symfony but also occasionally do frontend with Vue and Tailwind as well. 

Programming is something that excites me every day. There is so much to learn and something new almost every day. I'm thankful for having the opportunity to dig into topics that interest me while working.

In my spare time I read a lot of books. The topics range over psychology, personal growth, investing, organization, sci-fi and fantasy. The latest books I've read were Atomic Habits by James Clear, 1984 by George Orwell, Bobiverse 1-3 by Dennis E. Taylor (waiting for part 4 to be translated to german).

As a little site hustle if mine is designing T-Shirts and sell them on Merch by Amazon. I always wanted to draw my own vector graphics and this is the perfect opportunity to learn graphics design as well was marketing those on Amazon.
