Hello ðŸ‘‹,

my name is Steve I am a web developer from germany. I am passionate about software design and always trying to improve my skills.  

Programming is something that really excites me. There is so much to learn and something new almost every day. I'm thankful for having the opportunity to dig into topics that interest me while also working full time as a web developer.

## How did you come to development?

I graduated high school in 2012 and did an apprentice ship afterwards. My official job title is IT specialist for application development but web developer sounds cooler to me so I stick with that.

## What will you write on this blog?

I just made the decision to write a blog. My intention is to provide the knowledge that I collect over time on here. I learned so much from other people on the internet so why not add some value (hopefully) to the mix?
## What else?

In my spare time I read a lot of books. The topics range over psychology, personal growth, investing, organization, sci-fi and fantasy. The latest books I've read were Atomic Habits by James Clear, 1984 by George Orwell, Bobiverse 1-3 by Dennis E. Taylor (waiting for part 4 to be translated to german).

As a little site hustle if mine is designing T-Shirts and sell them on Merch by Amazon. This is a good practice to learn the basics of marketing. I am at the beginning still but I hope to generate a little pocket money for myself in the process.
