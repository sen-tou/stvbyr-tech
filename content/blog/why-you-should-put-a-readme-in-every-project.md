I don't know a single developer that loves to write documentation. But in contrast I know a lot that scream when there isn't one. Right so.

I you want to write excellent software you have to have good documentation. You could have the best code on the earth but without docs you will have a hard time manintaining it. 

What I don't want to do with this article: Comments. There is a lot of discussion around whether to use them at all, how much and when.

README to the rescue! But it's not hard to write documentation. All you need is a simple text file. Preferably Markdown and good structure.
