## Write code that is read by others

I worked with a lot of code bases during my 

* naming things properly 
* don't write complex comments try to express everything in code even if the names get long
* split concerns (a function name with an "and" in it probably can be split into two) 
* reduce cognitive overload as much as possible
* think about your public API twice. Renaming a public function name can break systems.

## Legacy code is the norm

Speaking about legacy code. There are the norm. You will be dealing with those on a regular basis. 

* 70/30 is my ratio of legacy 
* Make improvements one step at a time
* Rewrite small bits and don't add more confusing code.

## Listen and discuss to push code quality

* Listen to what others say. Especially from senior peers. They were where your are. Think about it. Try to implement it yourself and figure out if it works out for you.
* If you have advice or criticism say it. Ask the other if you can make comments. This will ensure that they are ready for it. Having an opinion and articulating it pushes for code quality.

## You get better if you actually code yourself

* Tutorials are good. They show what to do. But they will not learn you the craft.
* Come up with your own project idea and implement what you saw in the tutorial. Try to explore more than what you just saw. 
* Write tutorials for others so that you can consolidate your knowledge.
