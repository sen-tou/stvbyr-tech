I use obsidian for a while now and I have learned some things along the way that
you will probably also experience. Most of these things made sense over time as
I got more inspiration from others as well as my own experience with obsidian.

## To much concrete Information

I put to much concrete information into my vault. What I meant by that is hard
knowledge. Knowledge that you will find during research. I put it in without
much thought. I was just collecting ideas/concepts I deemed useful for a topic.

I think it's important to know why you research
something, what you expect from that data and why you take notes about it.

For me I use obsidian more like a index where I can go to and read about
something that I researched in the past. I want to know what I figured out and
where to find material that has further information about it should I be interested
in reading it again.

This is a huge help for me as I am a neurodivergend person. It is easier to keep
track of knowledge outside of my brain.

However I am not a researcher and I am not collecting knowledge to process it
further into papers or other scientific writings. I guess this would involve a
lot more written word.

This is why collecting huge chunks of information doesn't make sense for me.
It's the simple fact that I don't process it with the care a researcher would.

And thats the difference. I don't want to collect concrete knowledge. I want to
collect conclusions of topics I am interested in. Short sentences, short bullet
points. Everything else I can link to a source where I can read about if I want
to. In essence: I don't need to know everything just where to find it.

You have to assess what you want out of your vault and decide what to put into
it and what to rather link.

## The graph does not need to be "pretty"

I go out on a limb when I say that most of us want a perfect looking,
symmetrical graph. When you look on reddit there are a lot of people who share
their beautiful looking graphs. It's just so nice to look at.

However you can only achieve this when you have system layed out that follows
strict rules. Otherwise you end up with something like this.

    caption="Obsidian non structured graph"

This is the curated graph that I use for my programming related notes. There is
not a lot of structure in there. I have assigned some colors to the notes to
differentiate them and thats it.

The links however don't seem to follow a strict pattern. Some notes don't even have
connections yet. I link them the way it makes sense to me for one specific
topic.

This leads to a graph that is not "beautiful" because links are not made for
aesthetic reasons but rather logical ones.

This had influence in the way I use the graph now. A helpful application is
spotting notes without connection and deciding where they could fit. When you
have multiple topics it also interesting to see where they have cross
references to other topics.

## A little bit of structure is necessary

I said that I don't have a lot of structure in my vault. That doesn't meant that
I don't have any structure.

I created a little document inside my vault where I define some rules on how I
want to use the vault. This document contains things like:

- taxonomy (How are things called?)
- philosophy (Which principals to I want to follow during note taking?)
- structure and processes (How does the file/folder/link/tag structure look like?)
- categorization (How to categorize notes?)
- automation (What can I automate and how?)

These points don't have to be complicated. Let's give two examples on how these
can look like.

### Philosophy

This is what I wrote under "Philosophy":

> - It should be automated
>

> It should be obvious what to do, how to do it and where to put it. I don't want

> Syncing the vault for example should happen automatically without me doing
> anything.

This basically dictates how I want my vault to work on a meta level. The
automation part is in my opinion the most important one. I am distracted pretty
easily. Having less distraction and focusing on the note taking boost the the
quality of the content I put in.

### Note processing workflow

Let's look at another bit: The workflow I am using.

{{<img

    caption="Note processing workflow I use (flow chart)"
>}}

This is a flow chart of the process I am using to process notes that I put into
the system. It's simple and work perfectly for the manner hwo I use my vault.

One more thing to say about this document is that it is always work in progress.
Its not a bill that I enforce but rather a guide I follow. It good to question
your system from time to time and make changes when necessary.

You don't have to write a document like I did but you should think a little
about the structure and the way you want to use your vault.

## You don't have to use a note taking method, adapt it

Note taking methods like Zettelkasten are pretty popular because they all bring
structure and confidence into the system. They work because others proved that
they work.

If you are new to note taking it might be a good idea to research what methods
are out there. Reading about these gives you a broader horizon when
deciding how you want to take your notes.

This doesn't mean that you have to use all of these methods. It means that you
can pick the best cherries and create your own note taking system.

The best way to figure this out is to just try it out for yourself. There is
unfortunately no shortcut.

I for example figured out that the zettelkasten method is not really the way I
want to go. After researching and trying I took big inspiration from this

It is a pretty long video but has sections so you can jump around if you want.
