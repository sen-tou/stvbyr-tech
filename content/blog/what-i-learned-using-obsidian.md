I use obsidian for a while now and I have learned some things along the way that
you will probably also experience. Most of these things made sense over time as
I got more inspiration from others as well as my ow experience with obsidian.

## To much concrete Information

I put to much concrete information into my vault. What I meant by that is hard
knowledge. Knowledge that you will find during research. I put it in without
much thought. I was just collecting ideas/concepts I deemed useful for a topic.

What's wrong with that? I think it's important to know why you research
something, what you expect from that data and why you take notes about it.

For me I use obsidian more like a index where I can go to and read about
something that I researched in the past. I want to know what I figured out and
where to find material that has further information about it should I be interested
in reading it again.

This is a huge help for me as I am a neurodivergend person. It is easier to keep
track of knowledge outside of my brain.

However I am not a researcher and I am not collecting knowledge to process it
further into papers or other scientific writings. I guess this would involve a
lot more written word.

This is why collecting huge chunks of information doesn't make sense for me.
It's the simple fact that I don't process it with the care a researcher would.

And thats the difference. I don't want to collect concrete knowledge. I want to
collect conclusions of topics I am interested in. Short sentences, short bullet
points. Everything else I can link to a source where I can read about if I want
to. In essence: I don't need to know everything just where to find it.

You have to assess what you want out of your vault and decide what to put into
it and what to rather link.

## The graph does not need to be "pretty"

I go out on a limb when I say that most of us want a perfect looking,
symmetrical graph. When you look on reddit there are a lot of people who share
their beautiful looking graphs. It's just so nice to look at.

However you can only achieve this when you have system layed out that follows
strict rules. Otherwise you end up with something like this.

This is the curated graph that I use for my programming related notes. There is
not a lot of structure in there. I have assigned some colors to the notes to
differentiate them.

The links however don't follow a strict pattern. Some notes don't even have
connections yet. I link them the way it makes sense to me for one specific
topic.

This leads to a graph that is not "beautiful" because links are not made for
aesthetic reasons but rather logical ones.

This had influence in the way I use the graph now. A helpful application is
spotting notes without connection and deciding where they could fit. When you
have multiple topics it also interesting to see where they have cross
references to other topics.

I think this type of graph resembles our brain a bit more as we associate things
based on a variety of factors that aren't as beautiful as these reddit post are.
Don't get me wrong though I don't want to say anything negative about these
graph. They're just structured differently which is absolutely fine.
