Imposter Syndrome is another one of those buzzwords. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) says:
>Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their skills, talents or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

So in other words: you feel like your current knowledge and skillset is not enough. You feel that your not the right person for the job and that someone could find out and point a finger on you. Do you know this feeling?

From what I experienced, almost all developers are affected by imposter syndrome. So the first good thing about this is: your not alone. Plus their are a lot of resources in the wild that help with coping.

But before I go into more details about imposter syndrome and my experiences with it I want you to know that I am not a professional. This is purly my opinions, experiences and point of view. So if you feel like you need help: please talk to someone, a friend, a family member or a professional.

## I don't fit for the job

When I was fresh out of school I didn't know what to do. I went to different job events to figure out what I wanted to do. Software Development stroke my eye. So I thought, why not be a programmer? I enlisted myself for a workshop (it was free and hold by a local school) that thaught basics of programming. Simple HTML, CSS, JS and also some protcol/server basics.

You wanna know how I feelt most of the time during this week? I felt out of place. I felt dumb, because it seemed that everyone in this workshop knew a lot more than me. Which was not the case. I had a lot of questions the hole time but I was too afraid to ask them. I thought: If I ask this question now everyone would know that I am bad at programming and everyone would think that I don't belong.

Crazy right? Well, looking at now I think that was crazy. This course was meant for people that *NEVER* had anything to do with programming but still I thought I had to know everything that was thaught during the workshop.

After that experience I wanted to quit and search for another path that I could pursue. But, luckily, after a discussion with my parents I decided against quitting. I did an apprenticeship and eventually landed in web development where I am still today. 

And I love it.

From my todays point of view I couldn't imagine my a life without coding. What shocks me is that I almost didn't chose this path. Just because I feelt inferior and that I don't belong or didn't have the skills to do it.


##  What causes Imposter Syndrome?

In my 6 years of being a web developer now I couldn't think of a time where I needed the complex theoretic bulk stuff. You know things like data structures and waterfall methods. Hence a lot of companies what people to answer questions 

## What can I do

Dealing with imposter syndrome is a process. Their is no short path. At least I don't know of any. To be quiet honest I don't think that this feeling will ever go away and will stick. So what can I do?

As we've seen, imposter syndrome stems a lot from the environment that you're in. Do you were praised for your talents (and not your work)? Were you sourrounded by people that thinks they're better than you and did they project their expectations on you? 

In those situations you learn that only your talent is of value and if you don't provide that value you think that you are a failure. You will create such high expectations for yourself that you often times quit or don't even start. 

Are you a perfectionist? This is what I'm talking about. 

Changing 

I mentioned that a lot of programmers have had imposter syndrom or dealing with it right now. What helped me tremendeously was to talk about it with fellow developers or colleagues. Having people that go through the same things as you do can lead to very insightful conversations that actually help both parts.
